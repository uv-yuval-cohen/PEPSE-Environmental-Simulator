The trees package contains the following classes:
    Flora: Manages the creation, placement, and removal of trees.
    It ensures alignment to a grid and maintains active trees within a specified range.

    Tree: Handles the creation of a single tree, including its trunk, leaves, and fruits.
    It supports building and removing tree components dynamically.

    Trunk: Represents the trunk of a tree, rendered as a rectangular object with a brownish shade.
    The shade varies based on a given factor.

    Leaf: Represents a leaf in the game world.
    Leaves can move dynamically, changing their size and angle over time for a realistic effect.
    Fruit: Represents a fruit in the game world.
    Fruits are collectible items that can reward the player with energy when collected.

The classes in the trees package interact as follows:
    Flora and Tree:
    Flora is responsible for managing multiple Tree instances.
    It ensures that trees are created and removed dynamically based on the range it receives.
    Trees are spaced apart at intervals of 210px, ensuring consistent placement and alignment with the
    game world grid.
    Flora delegates the construction of each tree, including its trunk, leaves, and fruits, to the Tree class.

    Tree and Trunk:
    Each Tree instance contains a Trunk object, representing its main structure.
    The Trunk is created with customizable dimensions and shading.

    Tree and Leaf:
    Tree creates multiple Leaf objects to represent its foliage.
    Leaves are arranged in various shapes (e.g., square, triangle, diamond) and animated to enhance realism.

    Tree and Fruit:
    Tree can add fruits to its leaves. Fruits are managed through a callback mechanism to reward the player
    when collected.
    Fruits are dynamically added and removed as part of the Tree lifecycle.

    Inter-Class Integration:
    Tree, Trunk, Leaf, and Fruit are composed and managed by Flora to create a cohesive tree system in the
    game world.

The trees package incorporates the following design patterns:
    The primary design approach follows the specifications provided in the instruction file at 7.2.
    The Flora class acts as a central coordinator for managing both the terrain and the trees.
    By using the terrain's groundHeightAt(x) method, Flora determines where to create trees.
    This approach keeps the terrain and trees decoupled, with Flora handling all tree placement logic
    independently.
    The Tree class follows a composite design structure, combining its components (trunk, leaves, and fruits)
    into a single unified entity. This allows Flora to manage trees as cohesive objects,
    enabling both hierarchical organization and operations on individual parts when needed.
    The Fruit class uses a single observer mechanism with a runnable callback to notify when a fruit is
    collected.
    This allows the avatar or other systems to respond dynamically while maintaining loose coupling and
    flexibility.
